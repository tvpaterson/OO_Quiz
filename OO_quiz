# Polymorphism & Composition Homework - Quiz

# Polymorphism

1. What does the ___word___ 'polymorphism' mean?
A. Polymorphism means to have many forms

2. What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.
A. Applying polymorphism would result in class inheritance, here is an example:

    class Musician{
        public String playSomething(){
            return "Listen to my solo dude"
            }
    } 

    class Singer extends Drummer{
        public String playSomething(){
            return "Phil Colins solo"
        }
    }

3. What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?
A. Inheritance

4. How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?
A. 2 forms, it's original form and it's extended form.

5. Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.
A.     class Musician{
        public String playSomething(){
            return "Listen to my solo dude"
            }
    } 

    class Singer extends Drummer{
        public String playSomething(){
            return "Phil Colins solo"
        }
    }



# Composition and Aggregation

6. What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?
A. Composition has instances of other classes, it is a class in itself but it's made up of other classes. 

7. When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.
A. An example of compostion in Java:

    class Person(){
        
        Name name; * this would be another class *
        Age age; * this would be another class *

        Person(Name name, Age age){
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }
    }

8. Give a difference between composition and aggregation?
A.

9. What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition/aggregation?

10. When using composition, when an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?

11. When using aggregation, when an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?
